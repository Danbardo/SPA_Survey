# SPA_Survey
 This is a single page survey application developed in the pre-framework worked using jQuery mobile.
 
 The application was used to collect data from thousands of surveys in potentially rural locations.
 
 To cope with a lack of internet connection, the application utilises WebSQL which routinely synchronises with an external server.
 
 It is designed to be very easily to accommodate for different survey questions.
