# SPA Survey
 This is a single page survey application developed in the pre-framework world using jQuery mobile.
 
 The application was used to collect data from thousands of surveys in potentially rural locations. As it was used by a large number of staff members, a simple staff login is also incorporated for data collection purposes.
 
 To cope with a lack of internet connection, the application utilises WebSQL which routinely synchronises with an external server.
 
 It is designed to be very easily manipulated to accommodate for different survey questions.
